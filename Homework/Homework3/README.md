### (unbalanced) Chemical equations appear in an input file, one/line: compounds (or molecules) separated by a ‘+’ sign, while reactant and product separated by an ‘=’ sign - sample input/output below

##### (file input line) 	Hg(OH)2  + H3PO4 = Hg3(PO4)2 + H2O
##### (app output)	3Hg(OH)2  + 2 H3PO4 = 1Hg3(PO4)2 + 6H2O
