### Problem 1: 
Jet ski is one f the many ways boaters in Alaska fish (is it for real?), recreate, and access remote lakes, rivers, and coastline in the summer. Jet skis are propelled as the engine-powered impeller sucks in water from beneath the watercraft and shoots a high-powered jet of water behind it. They are equipped with highly efficient, fuel injected 4-stroke engines (sorry for this crap before getting to the meatðŸ˜Š)

##### A national jet ski manufacturer claims that their model XYZ 4-stroke jet skis last an average of 300 hours under normal use. A researcher randomly selected 20 XYZ jet skis from the manufacturerâ€™s production line and found their mean life span to be 270 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. Do we have enough evidence to reject the vendorâ€™s claim?

### Problem 2: 
Researchers have had only minimal success in identifying the neurochemical markers for evaluating life satisfaction or â€˜happiness.â€™ In fact, the most common way that researchers assess happiness is through self-reports. And, here is one your boss wants you to dig into.

##### A research study was conducted to examine the differences between older and younger adults on perceived life satisfaction (Figure 1). Ten older adults (age > 70) and ten younger adults (age 20 to 30) were given a life satisfaction test (known to have high reliability and validity; well, I donâ€™t buy it ðŸ˜Š). Scores on the measure range from 0 to 60 â€“ higher scores mean more satisfied. Do the appropriate t-test to determine if we have enough evidence to suggest that the difference in the two means is significant.

### Problem 3: 

Your bossâ€™s nephrologist and cardiologist seem to agree on the connection b/w their disciplines - heart can affect the health of kidneys, and kidneys can affect the health of heart. Your boss, being a hamster lover, is much more curious about the connection b/w hamstersâ€™ heart and kidney size! [Your boss is not off the wall as hamsters are a popular model for many human heart diseases and used to test a variety of therapies.]

##### Problem 3 Input.txt: 

Vital stats (heart and kidney size) of a sample of 73 hamsters. Do a linear regression fit of heart size as a function of kidney size. Test the null hypothesis that the population slope is 0 (i.e., no relationship b/w heart and kidney size)
