## Problem: 
##### Gather time series data from the US Geological Survey site NWISUV:mySite and do simple analyses. Use SOAP/SUD/DataFrame methods. 
##### The from/to time periods and mySite are input, all one line, for example: 3/5/2019 4/5/2020 04193500. Create a data frame with a DateTime index and store data for the following (each variableâ€™s data as a series). As well, add an extra series for water temperature in Fahrenheit.
 
###### 00010: water temperature (Celsius)
###### 00021: air temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)
###### 00035: Wind speed (miles per hour)	
###### 00060: Discharge (cubic feet per second)

#### Print three tables (nice format):
###### 1.	For each series, the daily averages (since many values may be reported for the same day)  - print just the tail() so the output is not too long. 
###### 2.	For each series  (across the entire time span), min, max, mean, and standard deviation
###### 3.	Rows for which any cell value is missing or 0 - just the tail() so the output is not too long

Plot all variables (except water temperature in Fahrenheit) in the same graph in a pretty format with nice legend. Use 100 cubic feet/sec as the unit for discharge, else graph may look squashed. The title of the graph is the name of the site (do not hard code the name).
